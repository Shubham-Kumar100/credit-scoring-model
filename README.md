## Credit Score Model
This project basically classifies the user through a score based on selected characteristics that brings powerful insights into who wants Credit. To obtain this credit score we need to use some Machine Learning techniques, so let's try to understand the steps below.

## First we understand our data, to process this data

For example, here we are eliminating the unnecessary column.

And here we are dealing with the missing data.

## Secondly, we need to find the outliers

Here we are analyzing the features and trying to find outliers to deal with.

And here we are eliminating these outliers.

## Thirdly, let's try to validate the correlation between the features and the score

## Fourth, we will create a new age range feature

Here we are creating the feature.

## Fifth, we need to do data preprocessing

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e97361f4-a78e-47db-a093-c01e3d922e90)

Here we are taking our features and transforming them into integer and float values.

## Sixth, let's train our model and test

Removing SCORE feature.

Training the model.

And now testing the model and getting the results.
